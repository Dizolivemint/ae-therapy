        I work with clients of all backgrounds with a variety of goals, primarily individual adults and couples. Clients that I work
        with may have experienced anxiety, depression, addictions, family and relationship conflict, disordered eating, lack
        of meaning, grief, miscarriage, spiritual or religious exploration, loss of a loved one, separation or divorce, questions
        around gender identity, domestic abuse, loss of a job, life transitions, or issues around sexual intimacy. I also
        work with individual clients wanting to deepen their connection to their authentic self and with couples who are
        interested in creating healthier ways of communicating and more meaningful intimacy.
