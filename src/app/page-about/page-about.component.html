        <p> I use an integrative approach incorporating wisdom from family systems theory, psychodynamic, mindfulness-based practices,
            imaginal and depth psychologies to assist in bringing forth insight, clarity, empowerment and transformation. I provide
            a safe, supportive, and respectful environment in which you can thoughtfully explore who you are, what you want and
            how to move forward with meaning and fulfillment.
